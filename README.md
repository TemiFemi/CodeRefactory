In this assignment, I was challenged to refactor, or improve an existing code without changing what it does. This task was extremely informative considering how refactoring is a vaulable tool for any developer to implement in their skillset. By Code Refactoring the available website, I was able to improve my ability to replace the 'div' elements with more detailed and concise semantic elements in html. I also learned that the more concise and clean your css and html, the better it is for not only yourself and your improving skills, but for the individuals that will be looking at your code.
